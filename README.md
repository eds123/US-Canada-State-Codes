# US-Canada-State-Codes

Simple lists of the two letter postal codes for each state/province in the United States and Canada.

Each are provided in JSON and YAML formats and use the [ISO 3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) standard.

These two formats can be used in Rails with the handy [Active Hash](https://github.com/zilkey/active_hash) gem

### [United States](US/)

50 states, 1 district (Washington DC) and 3 Overseas Military Destinations.

### [Canada](CA/)

10 provinces and 3 territories.
